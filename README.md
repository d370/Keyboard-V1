I have yet to name this keyboard as it is very much a work in progress but feel free to use it.

It is a Bluetooth split keyboard inspired by the Corne keyboard. It is designed to fit my hands, I angled the columns and moved the thumb cluster left.

I used 1400 mAh batteries (if you use smaller batteries feel free to shorten it), nice nano v2's, and choc switches. 

in terms of firmware am using one made by manna-harbour called miryoku.

(I plan on making my own at some point)
